  * @brief   Header for uart_driver.c file.
  *                 This file contains the common defines of the application.
  * 
  * 	uartManager has modes "process" and "bridge between uart ports". Firstly, you need
  * to select one of modes by setting mode variable. Then, select a strategy to recieve messages
  * by setting strategy variable. Terminator variable specifies the message end if strategy
  * is set to 1. If strategy is set to 0, timeConstant variable must be set to define how much
  * ms need to be waited until message is ended. If mode is set to 0 (meaning "process"), then
  * signal will raise once terminator recieved or timeConstant is over. You may process the 
  * message catching the signal. If mode is set to 1,2 or 3 (meaning "bridge"), once message
  * is recieved, message will be mirrored to uart1, uart2 or uart3 respectively.
  *
